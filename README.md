# [Gamedev GT] Into the Black Hole

A (very late) entry for the SantoJam game jam hosted by the GamedevGT community. The game is a work in progress.

The idea is to conquer all the planets in a solar system in order to conquer all the systems in a Universe, leading to the final conquering of the black hole in the center.

## Controls

* Left click: Select a planet (or anywhere else to deselect all)
* Shift + Left click: Add planet to selection
* Right click: Send half of the units from the selected planets to the clicked planet
* Escape: exit to main menu

The game was made using Unreal Engine 4 with mostly C++ classes (though a lot of Blueprints is used).
